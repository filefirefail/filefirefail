my name is filefirefail, i like python (i'm a beginner) and building projects beyond my capabilities.

i'm really interested in building a programming language, originally was building an esoteric language based on brainfuck stopped after 3 days because you need to actually have a lot of knowledge to build a unique interpreter that isn't a copy and paste of one that is already built.

now working on a language based on basic seeing that it has more documentation into building one especially for python.
